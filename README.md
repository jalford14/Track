# Track
Application that tracks how many miles you've run in a week along with some other features.

# How to install
Track is very easy to set up and install! Before you get started, make sure you have node.js installed on your machine. If not, grab the download from this link and follow the instructions.

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have Track and node downloaded, make your way to the root file where app.js is located. Track uses Express so you will have to run 
```
npm install express
```
at this location.

Then run 
```
node app.js
```
and make you way to localhost:3000 in whatever browser you choose.

Enjoy!
